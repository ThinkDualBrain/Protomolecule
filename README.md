Font based on the text seen in **'The Expanse'** show for things like credits and captions. Big thanks goes to [/u/xeow](https://www.reddit.com/u/xeow) who originally identified [DIN Pro as the base font](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/61mipk/the_expanse_alphabet/).

If you see any mistakes or problems, let me know and I'm happy to correct them.

## Legal Notice

Many have asked permission to use this font for your personal or commercial projects. So let me make 2 points clear:

1) I (personally) have no problem with anybody using the font for whatever they like. Big or small, commercial or hobby. I created and released this font for that exact purpose. But....

2) I am NOT the trademark holder or licensee for The Expanse nor it's artwork. This is a fan-made font, and I likely have no legal grounds for ownership of it. Additionally, both this font and the one used in the show are a modified version of the DIN Pro font, which I ALSO do not own a license for, nor can I grant usage rights to. So in both possible cases, I am not in a position to grant ANY legal protections. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

All that said, Enjoy!
